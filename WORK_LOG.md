| April 5      |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| October 25th |  2:40 - 3:00  |                    I began thinking about how I could approach the problem, I ended up deciding on making a large array where the indexes correspond to hashed values, and this array is made of arrayLists of strings. Then, I can go into the arrayList at the hashed value index and iteratively check to see which is the correct value to avoid collisions. |
| October 25th |  5:25 - 6:20  | I worked on implementing this idea, so far it is not working and I keep getting null values, I think I might have something wrong with my hashing. UPDATE: Ok so I think I actually just figured it out. I made a KeyValueEntry class which has each key and the corresponding value in it to check during the issue with collisions and this actually fixed it. |
| October 26th |  9:35 - 9:55  |                                                        I went through all the code and cleaned it up. I began by changing some confusing variable names so they were more clear, and then adding comments throughout. I think the code is much easier to read now and I think I can submit it. I also added the completed on date at the top of the Finder file. |
| October 29th |  8:25 - 8:40  |                                                                                                                           I removed the constructor where I initialized every spot in the array with a new arrayList because this was unnecessary. Instead, I only now initialize the locations in the array if they are actually used, which led to a speed up. |
| October 30th |  1:00 - 1:10  |                                                                                                                                                                   I changed my array of arraylists into an array of queues because the backlink reference from the arraylist was unnecessary. I don't see any speed up but it should use less storage space now. |
| November 1st | 11:50 - 12:28 |                                                                                                                                    I began working on Linear Probing by making a hashMap and moving lots of my code/deleting it. Currently I have some issues with null values being checked, I'll need to figure out why this is happening tonight or tomorrow. |
